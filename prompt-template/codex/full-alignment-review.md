# FULL GOAL ALIGNMENT CHECK - Round {{CURRENT_ROUND}}

This is a **mandatory checkpoint** (at configurable intervals). You must conduct a comprehensive goal alignment audit.

## Original Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT**: The original plan that Claude is implementing is located at:
@{{PLAN_FILE}}

You MUST read this plan file first to understand the full scope of work before conducting your review.
Only items under `## Acceptance Criteria` and current-scope Task Breakdown rows are completion gates.
Items under `## Future Work` / `## Out of Scope`, including `FUT-*` items, are informational and MUST NOT block the COMPLETE verdict.
If a current-scope AC or current-scope task is deferred, treat it as incomplete.

## Part 1: Goal Tracker Audit (MANDATORY)

Read @{{GOAL_TRACKER_FILE}} and verify:

### 1.1 Acceptance Criteria Status
For EACH Acceptance Criterion in the IMMUTABLE SECTION:
| AC | Status | Evidence (if MET) | Blocker (if NOT MET) | Justification (if DEFERRED) |
|----|--------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| AC-1 | MET / PARTIAL / NOT MET / DEFERRED | ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 1.2 Forgotten Items Detection
Compare the original plan (@{{PLAN_FILE}}) with the current goal-tracker:
- Are there tasks that are neither in "Active", "Completed", nor "Deferred"?
- Are there tasks marked "complete" in summaries but not verified?
- List any forgotten items found.

### 1.3 Deferred Items Audit
For each item in "Explicitly Deferred":
- Is the deferral justification still valid?
- Should it be un-deferred based on current progress?
- Does it contradict the Ultimate Goal?

### 1.4 Goal Completion Summary
```
Acceptance Criteria: X/Y met (Z deferred)
Active Tasks: N remaining
Estimated remaining rounds: ?
Critical blockers: [list if any]
```

## Part 1.5: Kernel Optimization Guidance (when applicable)

If the plan involves kernel optimization (CUDA, Triton, AscendC, or similar GPU/NPU work), assess the optimization trajectory before judging alignment:

**History and profiling audit**: Read `leaderboard.csv`, `docs/draft.md` if present, `git log --oneline -- solution/`, and available profiler output/benchmark traces to understand past attempts, peak speedup, rejected approaches, measured bottlenecks, and whether Claude acknowledged this history. If Claude's recent work repeats a previously rejected approach without justification, or makes optimization claims without profiling/benchmark evidence where profiling was feasible, flag this as a mainline gap.

**Profile-guided bottleneck assessment**: Identify whether the evidence points to memory bandwidth, memory access pattern/coalescing, occupancy, register pressure, shared-memory behavior, synchronization, compute throughput, launch overhead, or another bottleneck. Use this profiling analysis as a primary input when judging whether the optimization strategy is sound.

**Structural plateau assessment**: Check whether leaderboard speedup has plateaued across recent rounds while Claude keeps editing the same kernel structure. If the same structure has been tuned for 2+ rounds without meaningful improvement, recommend a structural rewrite or fundamentally different parallelization/data-layout strategy rather than more incremental tuning, tied to the profiling evidence where available.

**KernelWiki consultation**: Consult the **KernelWiki** knowledge base to assess the optimization trajectory and provide guidance. If progress has stalled, query KernelWiki for alternative approaches relevant to the profiling-identified bottlenecks. Include a brief "Profiling and KernelWiki Optimization Recommendations" subsection with bottleneck diagnosis, profiling observations, recommended techniques (with wiki page references), and suggested next direction. Profiling analysis and KernelWiki guidance are equally important evidence sources. These suggestions are advisory and must not block the COMPLETE verdict on their own.

## Part 2: Mainline Drift Audit (MANDATORY)

Determine whether the recent rounds are still serving the original plan:
- Is the current round's mainline objective clear and singular?
- Has Claude been advancing mainline ACs, or mostly clearing side issues?
- Which findings are true **blocking side issues** versus merely **queued side issues**?

Include a short drift summary:
```
Mainline Progress Verdict: ADVANCED / STALLED / REGRESSED
Blocking Side Issues: N
Queued Side Issues: N
```

The `Mainline Progress Verdict` line is mandatory. If you omit it, the Humanize stop hook will block the round and require the review to be rerun.

## Part 3: Implementation Review

- Conduct a deep critical review of the implementation
- Verify Claude's claims match reality
- Identify any gaps, bugs, or incomplete work
- Reference @{{DOCS_PATH}} for design documents

## Part 4: {{GOAL_TRACKER_UPDATE_SECTION}}

## Part 5: Progress Stagnation Check (MANDATORY for Full Alignment Rounds)

To implement the original plan at @{{PLAN_FILE}}, we have completed **{{COMPLETED_ITERATIONS}} iterations** (Round 0 to Round {{CURRENT_ROUND}}).

The project's `.humanize/rlcr/{{LOOP_TIMESTAMP}}/` directory contains the history of each round's iteration:
- Round input prompts: `round-N-prompt.md`
- Round output summaries: `round-N-summary.md`
- Round review prompts: `round-N-review-prompt.md`
- Round review results: `round-N-review-result.md`

**How to Access Historical Files**: Read the historical review results and summaries using file paths like:
- `@.humanize/rlcr/{{LOOP_TIMESTAMP}}/round-{{PREV_ROUND}}-review-result.md` (previous round)
- `@.humanize/rlcr/{{LOOP_TIMESTAMP}}/round-{{PREV_PREV_ROUND}}-review-result.md` (2 rounds ago)
- `@.humanize/rlcr/{{LOOP_TIMESTAMP}}/round-{{PREV_ROUND}}-summary.md` (previous summary)

**Your Task**: Review the historical review results, especially the **recent rounds** of development progress and review outcomes, to determine if the development has stalled.

**Possible Signs of Stagnation** (use judgment; these are not automatic STOP triggers):
- Same high-impact issue persists across multiple rounds and continues to block current-scope Acceptance Criteria
- Little or no measurable progress on current-scope Acceptance Criteria over several rounds
- Claude repeats the same mistake after prior review feedback clearly explained the correction
- Discussion or implementation loops back to already-rejected approaches without new evidence or rationale
- No substantive code, test, or design changes despite continued iterations
- Codex gives similar mainline feedback repeatedly and Claude does not address it
- For kernel optimization tasks: leaderboard speedup has plateaued for 3+ consecutive rounds, profiling evidence does not support the repeated incremental edits to the same kernel structure, and prior review feedback already requested a structural pivot or clear justification

**STOP guidance**: Write **STOP** only when the pattern is persistent, blocks meaningful progress toward current-scope goals, and there is no credible next action likely to recover progress. Otherwise, write concrete action items and allow another round.

## Part 6: Output Requirements

- If issues found OR any current-scope AC is NOT MET (including deferred current-scope ACs), write your findings to @{{REVIEW_RESULT_FILE}}
- Include specific action items for Claude to address, classified into:
  - Mainline Gaps
  - Blocking Side Issues
  - Queued Side Issues
- **If development is stagnating** (see Part 4), write "STOP" as the last line
- **CRITICAL**: Only write "COMPLETE" as the last line if ALL current-scope ACs from the original plan are FULLY MET with no deferrals
  - DEFERRED current-scope items are considered INCOMPLETE - do NOT output COMPLETE if any current-scope AC is deferred
  - The ONLY condition for COMPLETE is: all current-scope original plan tasks are done, all current-scope ACs are met, no current-scope deferrals allowed
