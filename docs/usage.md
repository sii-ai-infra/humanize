# Humanize Usage Guide

Detailed usage documentation for the Humanize plugin. For installation, see [Install for Claude Code](install-for-claude.md).

## How It Works

Humanize creates an iterative feedback loop with two phases:

1. **Implementation Phase**: Claude works on your plan, Codex reviews summaries until COMPLETE
2. **Review Phase**: `codex review --base <branch>` checks code quality with `[P0-9]` severity markers

The loop continues until all acceptance criteria are met or no issues remain.

## Begin with the End in Mind

Before the RLCR loop starts any work, Humanize runs a **Plan Understanding Quiz** -- a brief pre-flight check that verifies you genuinely understand the plan you are about to execute.

### Why This Exists

The most expensive failure in AI-assisted development is not a bug. It is running a 40-round RLCR loop on a plan you never actually read. We call this **wishful coding**: treating a generated plan like a wish -- toss it in, hope for the best, check back later.

The problem is structural. An RLCR loop is an amplifier: it will faithfully execute whatever plan you give it. If the plan is wrong, the loop makes it wrong faster and at scale. If the plan is right but you do not understand it, you cannot course-correct when Codex raises questions, and the loop drifts.

Understanding your plan before execution is not optional overhead. It is the single highest-leverage thing you can do to ensure the loop succeeds.

### How the Quiz Works

When you run `start-rlcr-loop`, an independent agent analyzes the plan and generates two multiple-choice questions about the plan's technical implementation details:

1. **What components are changing and how?** -- Tests whether you know the core mechanism.
2. **How do the pieces connect?** -- Tests whether you understand the architecture being modified.

If you answer both correctly, the loop proceeds immediately. If you miss one or both, Humanize explains what the plan actually does and offers a choice: proceed anyway, or stop and review.

The quiz is advisory, not a gate. You always have the option to proceed. But that moment of friction -- the two seconds it takes to read the question and realize you do not know the answer -- is the entire point.

### Skipping the Quiz

- `--skip-quiz` -- Skip the quiz only. The rest of the RLCR loop behaves normally.
- `--yolo` -- Skip the quiz AND let Claude answer Codex's open questions directly (`--claude-answer-codex`). This is full automation mode for users who have already reviewed the plan and want to hand over complete control.
- Plans started via `gen-plan --auto-start-rlcr-if-converged` skip the quiz automatically, because the gen-plan convergence discussion already verified the user's understanding.

## Typical Planning Flow

1. Generate the initial implementation plan:
   ```bash
   /humanize:gen-plan --input draft.md --output docs/plan.md
   ```
2. If the plan is reviewed with comment annotations, refine it and generate a QA ledger:
   ```bash
   /humanize:refine-plan --input docs/plan.md
   ```
3. Start the RLCR loop on the refined plan:
   ```bash
   /humanize:start-rlcr-loop docs/plan.md
   ```

## Command Reference

### gen-idea

```
/humanize:gen-idea <idea-text-or-path> [--n <int>] [--output <path>]
```

Generates a repo-grounded idea draft using directed-diversity exploration. A lead agent picks N orthogonal directions, N parallel Explore subagents develop each direction with objective evidence from the repo, and the lead synthesizes a draft with one primary direction plus N-1 alternatives.

**Outputs:**
- Draft file: `.humanize/ideas/<slug>-<timestamp>.md` (or `--output` path)
- Companion JSON: `<draft-path-without-.md>.directions.json` — lossless record of all direction proposals, used as input to `explore-idea`

**Options:**
- `--n <int>` — number of parallel directions (default: 6)
- `--output <path>` — custom output path for the draft (must have `.md` suffix)

### explore-idea

```
/humanize:explore-idea <draft.md | draft.directions.json> [--directions ids] [--concurrency N] [--max-worker-iterations N] [--worker-timeout-min N] [--codex-timeout-min N]
```

Launches bounded parallel prototype workers — one per selected direction — each running in an isolated git worktree. After all workers complete, synthesizes an explore report plus a plan-ready final idea:
- **Tier 1**: Best product direction (ranked by user value, evidence, strategic fit)
- **Tier 2**: Most implementation-ready prototype (ranked by outcome: task status, Codex verdict, tests, commits)

**Options:**
- `--directions <ids>` — comma-separated `direction_id` or `source_index` values to run (default: first 6 by display order)
- `--concurrency <N>` — parallel worker count (default: 6, max: 10)
- `--max-worker-iterations <N>` — per-worker iteration cap (default: 2, max: 3)
- `--worker-timeout-min <N>` — worker timeout in minutes (default: 60, max: 60)
- `--codex-timeout-min <N>` — Codex call timeout in minutes (default: 20, max: 20)

**Run artifacts** stored in `.humanize/explore/<RUN_ID>/`:
- `manifest.json` — coordinator state and per-worker metadata
- `dispatch-prompts/` — exact prompts sent to each worker
- `worker-results.jsonl` — machine-readable result rows
- `explore-report.md` — audit report with two-tier rankings, adoption paths, and cleanup guidance
- `final-idea.md` — plan-ready synthesis artifact for `/humanize:gen-plan`

Default follow-up:
```bash
/humanize:gen-plan --input .humanize/explore/<run-id>/final-idea.md --output docs/plan.md
/humanize:start-rlcr-loop docs/plan.md
```

  -h, --help             Show help message
```

### gen-plan

```
/humanize:gen-plan --input <path/to/draft.md> --output <path/to/plan.md> [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  --input   Path to the input draft file (required)
  --output  Path to the output plan file (required)
  --auto-start-rlcr-if-converged
             Start the RLCR loop automatically when the plan is converged
             (discussion mode only; ignored in --direct)
  --discussion  Use discussion mode (iterative Claude/Codex convergence rounds)
  --direct      Use direct mode (skip convergence rounds, proceed immediately to plan)
  --coach
             Run mandatory short-answer stage quizzes before expanding each planning layer
  -h, --help             Show help message
```

The gen-plan command transforms rough draft documents into structured implementation plans.

Workflow:
1. Validates input/output paths
2. Checks if draft is relevant to the repository
3. Analyzes draft for clarity, consistency, completeness, and functionality
4. Engages user to resolve any issues found
5. When `--coach` is enabled, runs mandatory stage quizzes after each planning stage; normal plan decision questions stay separate, and quiz mismatches become design drift, AI design corrections, or background gaps before overall acceptance
6. Generates a structured plan.md with acceptance criteria
7. Optionally starts `/humanize:start-rlcr-loop` if `--auto-start-rlcr-if-converged` conditions are met

If reviewers later annotate the generated plan with comment blocks, run
`/humanize:refine-plan --input <plan.md>` before starting or resuming implementation.

### refine-plan

```
/humanize:refine-plan --input <path/to/annotated-plan.md> [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
  --input <path>        Path to the annotated plan file (required)
  --output <path>       Path to the refined plan output file
                        Defaults to refining --input in place
  --qa-dir <path>       Directory for QA document output
                        Default: .humanize/plan_qa
  --alt-language <LANG>
                        Generate translated plan and QA variants
                        Supported: zh, ko, ja, es, fr, de, pt, ru, ar
                        Full language names are also accepted; en/English is a no-op
  --discussion          Interactive mode for ambiguous comment classification
  --direct              Non-interactive mode; makes minimal safe assumptions
  -h, --help            Show help message
```

The refine-plan command reads an annotated `gen-plan` document, processes embedded review
comments, removes those comment blocks from the final plan, and writes a QA ledger that records
how each comment was handled.

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Refine a plan in place and write QA output to the default directory
/humanize:refine-plan --input docs/plan.md

# Write the refined plan to a new file and store QA output in a custom directory
/humanize:refine-plan --input docs/plan.annotated.md --output docs/plan.refined.md --qa-dir docs/plan-qa

# Run in direct mode and generate translated variants
/humanize:refine-plan --input docs/plan.md --direct --alt-language zh
```

**Annotated comment block format:**

`refine-plan` supports three comment formats for reviewer annotations. Both inline
and multi-line comment blocks are supported in all formats:

**Classic format (CMT:/ENDCMT):**
```markdown
Text before CMT: clarify why AC-3 is split here ENDCMT text after
```

```markdown
CMT:
Please investigate whether this task should depend on task4 or task5.
If the dependency is unclear, add a pending decision instead of guessing.
ENDCMT
```

**Short tag format (<cmt></cmt>):**
```markdown
Text before <cmt>clarify why AC-3 is split here</cmt> text after
```

```markdown
<cmt>
Please investigate whether this task should depend on task4 or task5.
If the dependency is unclear, add a pending decision instead of guessing.
</cmt>
```

**Long tag format (<comment></comment>):**
```markdown
Text before <comment>clarify why AC-3 is split here</comment> text after
```

```markdown
<comment>
Please investigate whether this task should depend on task4 or task5.
If the dependency is unclear, add a pending decision instead of guessing.
</comment>
```

Rules:
- At least one non-empty comment block must exist in the input file.
- Comment markers inside fenced code blocks or HTML comments are ignored.
- Empty comment blocks are removed but do not create QA ledger entries.
- The input plan must still follow the `gen-plan` section schema.
- All three formats can be mixed within the same file.

**QA output structure:**

For an input plan named `plan.md`, the default QA output path is `.humanize/plan_qa/plan-qa.md`.
The generated QA document includes:

- `## Summary`: overall refinement outcome and comment counts
- `## Comment Ledger`: one row per raw `CMT-N` block with classification, location, excerpt, and disposition
- `## Answers`: responses to question comments and any clarifying edits
- `## Research Findings`: repository research performed for `research_request` comments
- `## Plan Changes Applied`: changes made for `change_request` comments and cross-reference updates
- `## Remaining Decisions`: unresolved items or assumption-heavy decisions that still need user input
- `## Refinement Metadata`: input/output paths, QA path, classification counts, modified sections, convergence status, and date

Disposition values in the ledger are `answered`, `applied`, `researched`, `deferred`, or
`resolved`.

If `--alt-language` is set to a supported non-English language, the command also generates
translated plan and QA variants by inserting `_<code>` before the file extension, such as
`plan_zh.md` and `plan-qa_zh.md`.

### ask-codex

```
/humanize:ask-codex [OPTIONS] <question or task>

OPTIONS:
  --codex-model <MODEL:EFFORT>
                         Codex model and reasoning effort (default from config, fallback gpt-5.5:high)
  --codex-profile <PROFILE>
                         Codex config profile (`codex -p PROFILE`) for the query
  --codex-timeout <SECONDS>
                         Timeout for the Codex query in seconds (default: 3600)
  -h, --help             Show help message
```

The ask-codex skill sends a one-shot question or task to Codex and returns the response
inline. Unlike the RLCR loop, this is a single consultation without iteration -- useful
for getting a second opinion, reviewing a design, or asking domain-specific questions.

Responses are saved to `.humanize/skill/<timestamp>/` with `input.md`, `output.md`,
and `metadata.md` for reference.

## Configuration

Humanize uses a 4-layer config hierarchy (lowest to highest priority):
1. **Plugin defaults**: `config/default_config.json`
2. **User config**: `~/.config/humanize/config.json`
3. **Project config**: `.humanize/config.json`
4. **CLI flags**: Command-line arguments (where available)

Current built-in keys:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `codex_model` | `gpt-5.5` | Shared default model for Codex-backed review and analysis; any Codex CLI-supported model name is allowed |
| `codex_profile` | `""` | Optional Codex config profile passed as `codex -p PROFILE` |
| `codex_effort` | `high` | Shared default reasoning effort (`xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) |
| `bitlesson_model` | `haiku` | Model used by the BitLesson selector agent |
| `provider_mode` | unset | Optional runtime mode hint such as `codex-only` |
| `agent_teams` | `false` | Project-level default for agent teams workflow |
| `alternative_plan_language` | `""` | Optional translated plan variant language; supported values include `Chinese`, `Korean`, `Japanese`, `Spanish`, `French`, `German`, `Portuguese`, `Russian`, `Arabic`, or ISO codes like `zh` |
| `gen_plan_mode` | `discussion` | Default plan-generation mode |

### Codex Model Configuration

All Codex-using features (RLCR loop, ask-codex) share the same model configuration. The value is passed through to the Codex CLI, so it may be any model name supported by your Codex installation as long as it contains only letters, numbers, slashes, dots, underscores, and hyphens:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `codex_model` | `gpt-5.5` | Model used for Codex operations (reviews, analysis, queries); any Codex CLI-supported model name is allowed |
| `codex_profile` | `""` | Optional Codex config profile passed as `codex -p PROFILE` |
| `codex_effort` | `high` | Reasoning effort (`xhigh`, `high`, `medium`, `low`) |

To override, add to `.humanize/config.json`:

```json
{
  "codex_model": "glm-5.2",
  "codex_profile": "glm",
  "codex_effort": "high",
  "bitlesson_model": "sonnet"
}
```

On Codex installs, Humanize also seeds `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/humanize/config.json`
with a Codex/OpenAI `bitlesson_model` and `provider_mode: "codex-only"` when those keys
are unset, so BitLesson selection stays on the Codex/OpenAI path without probing Claude.

Codex model is resolved with this precedence:
1. CLI `--codex-model` / `--codex-profile` flags (highest priority)
2. Feature-specific defaults
3. Config-backed defaults from the 4-layer hierarchy above
4. Hardcoded fallback (`gpt-5.5:high`, no profile)

**Migration note**: If your `.humanize/config.json` contains the legacy keys
`loop_reviewer_model` or `loop_reviewer_effort`, they are silently ignored.
Use `codex_model` and `codex_effort` instead.


## Monitoring

Set up the monitoring helper for real-time progress tracking:

```bash
# Add to your .bashrc or .zshrc
source ~/.claude/plugins/cache/PolyArch/humanize/<LATEST.VERSION>/scripts/humanize.sh

# Terminal monitors (one project per terminal):
humanize monitor rlcr        # latest RLCR loop log
humanize monitor skill       # all skill invocations (codex + gemini)
humanize monitor codex       # ask-codex skill invocations only
humanize monitor gemini      # ask-gemini skill invocations only

# Browser dashboard (multiple loops at once, foreground default):
humanize monitor web --project /path/to/project
```

Progress data is stored in `.humanize/rlcr/<timestamp>/` for each loop session.

### Browser dashboard (`humanize monitor web`)

The web dashboard layers on top of the same `.humanize/rlcr/<session>/`
metadata and `~/.cache/humanize/<sanitized-project>/<session>/round-*-codex-{run,review}.log`
cache logs that the terminal monitors read. There is no parallel
capture pipeline; the dashboard is a reader, not a writer.

Lifecycle (per DEC-1, DEC-3):

- Foreground default (`humanize monitor web --project <path>`). Press
  Ctrl+C to stop. The server is CLI-fixed to one project at startup;
  to monitor several projects simultaneously, run multiple instances
  (one per project) with different `--port` values.
- `--daemon` runs the same server inside a per-project tmux session
  (`humanize-viz-<8-hex>`); use `viz-stop.sh --project <path>` or
  the project's own tmux kill command to stop it.

Per-session inline live log panes appear on the home page for every
active session, driven by Server-Sent Events from
`/api/sessions/<session_id>/logs/<basename>`. Multiple loops stream
in parallel without leaving the home page.

### Remote browser access

The dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. To expose it over the
network, supply `--host` and an authentication token. The token is
required for any non-loopback host; the server refuses to start
otherwise.

Token-aware endpoints honor `Authorization: Bearer <tok>` for normal
fetch requests and `?token=<tok>` query parameters for the SSE stream
(per DEC-4: browsers cannot set arbitrary headers on EventSource).
WebSocket transport is rejected entirely in remote mode.

#### Pattern 1 (recommended): SSH tunnel

The safest remote pattern keeps the server bound to localhost and
forwards the port over SSH:

```bash
# On the server machine:
humanize monitor web --project /path/to/project --port 18000

# On your laptop:
ssh -N -L 18000:localhost:18000 user@server.example.com
# Then open http://localhost:18000 in the local browser.
```

No token is required because the server still binds to loopback. The
SSH tunnel provides authentication and encryption.

#### Pattern 2: Direct LAN bind

For trusted-network deployments where SSH tunneling is impractical:

```bash
# Generate a strong random token (one-time):
TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"

# Start the dashboard:
humanize monitor web \
    --project /path/to/project \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 18000 \
    --auth-token "$TOKEN"

# Or supply the token via env var instead of CLI:
HUMANIZE_VIZ_TOKEN="$TOKEN" humanize monitor web \
    --project /path/to/project --host 0.0.0.0 --port 18000
```

Open the dashboard with `http://server:18000/?token=<TOKEN>` once;
the browser caches the token in `sessionStorage` and propagates it
on subsequent fetches and SSE reconnects.

## Cancellation

- **RLCR loop**: `/humanize:cancel-rlcr-loop`

## Environment Variables

### HUMANIZE_CODEX_BYPASS_SANDBOX

**WARNING: This is a dangerous option that disables security protections. Use only if you understand the implications.**

- **Purpose**: Controls whether Codex runs with sandbox protection
- **Default**: Not set (uses `--full-auto` with sandbox protection)
- **Values**:
  - `true` or `1`: Bypasses Codex sandbox and approvals (uses `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`)
  - Any other value or unset: Uses safe mode with sandbox

**When to use this**:
- Linux servers without landlock kernel support (where Codex sandbox fails)
- Automated CI/CD pipelines in trusted environments
- Development environments where you have full control

**When NOT to use this**:
- Public or shared development servers
- When reviewing untrusted code or pull requests
- Production systems
- Any environment where unauthorized system access could cause damage

**Security implications**:
- Codex will have unrestricted access to your filesystem
- Codex can execute arbitrary commands without approval prompts
- Review all code changes carefully when using this mode

**Usage example**:
```bash
# Export before starting Claude Code
export HUMANIZE_CODEX_BYPASS_SANDBOX=true

# Or set for a single session
HUMANIZE_CODEX_BYPASS_SANDBOX=true claude --plugin-dir /path/to/humanize
```
